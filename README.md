# Password Generator by Mark Kanczuzewski

The purpose of this exersize was to create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It has a clean and polished user interface and is responsive, which ensures that it adapts to multiple screen sizes. The following are the critera for the exersize:

1. Generate a form using HTML and CSS to preset the user with a button for interaction to start the password generation process and display the resulting password to the user. 
2. Require the user to pick a password length from 8 to 128 characters. 
3. Present the user with a series of prompts with critera to generate the password including lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters. 
4. Require the user to pick at least one of the critera in number 3. 
5. Send the password with the requirements gathered in numbers 2-4 back to the HTML form.
